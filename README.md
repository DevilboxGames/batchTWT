BatchTwat v1.0
=======================

Installation
==============================
No need for installation, if you have .NET v4.5 installed it'll just work!
If you don't have .NET v4.5 then you'll need to get that sorted.

General Info
==============================
BatchTwat is a one-trick pony.  Any directories in the same directory as the exe will be twatted.  Any PIX* folders within /those/ folders will be pixified.

It supports:
Making .twt files
Generating PIXIES.P16 from PIX16
Generating PIXIES.P08 from PIX8

But what does it /do/?
Makes life really easy in rather specific and uncommon circumstances.

Commandline Options
==============================
None

Changelog
==============================
2013-10-21	v1.0.0

* Initial release

Known bugs/limitations
==============================
Because this is a .NET app it is unlikely to work under linux or apple OS without jiggery and/or pokery.  I shall leave this as an exercise to the user and offer no form of support on these platforms.

The Boring Bit
==============================
I accept NO reponsibility for any damage of any form these files may cause your machine, install these files at your own risk!
If your computer screws up it is not our fault!
